stompclt
========

stompclt is a versatile tool to interact with messaging brokers speaking
STOMP[1] and/or message queues (see Messaging::Message::Queue[2]) on disk.

It receives messages (see Messaging::Message[3]) from an incoming module,
optionally massaging them (i.e. filtering and/or modifying), and sends
them to an outgoing module. Depending on which modules are used, the tool
can perform different operations.
